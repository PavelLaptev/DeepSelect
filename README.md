# DeepSelect

A quick and easy way to select layers inside a group, filtering by layer type

## What?

Have you ever needed to select all the layers inside groups?
Or maybe just all the text layers, to be able to change typeface for all of them in one step?
DeepSelect does that.

## How to intall

### Sketch Runner

Sketch Runner is great, use it :)
Open Sketch runner, search fon the plugin by name, and click "Install".
[http://sketchrunner.com]()

### Manually

1. Download the ZIP file and unzip it
2. Open Sketch DeepSelect.sketchplugin

* You may create a [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc) file in your project's root directory. Any settings you define here will overwrite matching config-keys within skpm preset. For example, if you pass a "presets" object, it will replace & reset all Babel presets that skpm defaults to.

* If you'd like to modify or add to the existing Babel config, you must use a `webpack.skpm.config.js` file. Visit the [Webpack](#webpack) section for more info.
